    `A butterfly was a caterpillar 🐛, that caterpillar realized its ugly sides and decided to turn into that sweet creature 🎀, into
             a butterfly 🦋! and to add beauty to every place it goes to 🦸‍♀️! 
            This proess really inpires me a lot 💫. Realizing our ugly sides and making an effort to beautify them and to add beauty, kindness 
            and softness to every place we go to are really important and pricesless things 🎁, and they really worth 💎. Maybe making the 
            world a better place to live starts in this way ✨! Who knows?! 😉 
            So, let's be butterflies, let's spread beauty! 🤗
